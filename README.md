# Private Library
This is the first project from [The Odin Project Full Stack JavaScript path](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript).  <br />
You can try it live [here](https://razvanbugoi.github.io/top-library/src/index.html). <br />
Please note that this is not mobile responsive as this was not a requirement.


## Objective
The main focus of this project was to get myself comfortable using Objects and Object Constructors.
This project allow the users to create their own private library by adding books to the table and toggle the read status of each book.


## Technologies used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript


## The process and outcome
I started this project by creating a basic form to get the input from the user. I then created a basic table that would be dynamically populated with books once the form is submited. <br />

The next step was to work on the JavaScript logic and create all the necessary functions to make the application work as intended. There were a few obstacles in JavaScript that I had to overcome along the way, but after hours of working on this project, I am happy to have succeeded!  <br />
